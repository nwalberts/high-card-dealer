## Part 1

**What type of application are you building?**

**Is it a program that runs in our terminal? A web application? An API?
Who are our users?**

**Who will be using our app?**

**Are there different types of users (a visitor, a signed-in user, an admin)?**

**What is each user's journey? How do they realize the benefit of using the application?**

**What are the ways in which each user will interact with the application?**

**What are the chronological steps?**

##Part 2

We will often refer to these as features. We will want to make a list of each feature in our application by creating a step by step workflow of the user's experience with our application.

**What challenges do we anticipate, and what resources do we have to support us?**

**Have you worked with the technologies needed to create this feature?
Gather resources to tackle those challenges, i.e. lessons, online documentation, etc.**

For each feature, identify our user story and acceptance criteria (sometimes, it may be provided for you!). You can find additional information on user stories here. This user story will include details such as:

Who is the involved user?
What do we want that user to be able to do?
Why do they need to do this thing?
What do we want each feature to look like? Usually, for web applications this takes the form of a sketch (called a wireframe). For command line applications, usually we provide sample output.
*This is mostly already done for us*

**In the terminal, is there any formatting we need to apply?**

## Part 3
If you have chosen to pair program, consider and discuss the following questions before beginning:

Are there particular areas of strength for us as individuals? As a pair?
Are there specific areas we're hoping to improve?
What can we do to make pairing help us move forward in our understanding/how can we best support each other?
How do we want to split our time as driver/navigator?
Be honest, be open, share your strengths and weaknesses as a developer, and signal your intention to grow.

## Part 4 Tests

Coming Soon...


## Part 5 Prep
What are the necessary objects for this feature (what classes, or models, do we have to create)?
What does each object need to keep track of (what attributes should that class have)?
What behaviors does each object need to have (what methods do we need to write)?
